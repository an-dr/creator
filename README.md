2. Set up templates:
    - Place your templates in `~/.creator-templates`, or
    - Define a custom location using the `CREATOR_TEMPLATES` environment variable.
3. Add Creator to PATH:
    - Ensure the application directory is included in your system's PATH.
4. Run Creator:
    - Navigate to the directory where you want to create a new project and run: creator.
5. Exit the application:
    - Use `q` or `Ctrl+C` to close.


## ðŸŒ± Environment variables

- `CREATOR_TEMPLATES`: Specifies the path to your templates directory.

## ðŸ“‚ Template Structure

### Storage Layout

```plaintext
Storage/
    |- group_a/
    |  |- template_directory_a/
    |  |  |- [files and dirs]
    |  |- template_directory_b/
    |  |  |- [files and dirs]
    |  |  |- ...
    |  ...
    |
    |- group_b/
    |  |- template_directory_a/
    |  |  |- [files and dirs]
    |  ...
    |
    ...
    
```

Note: dotfiles and directories are ignored by the application.

### Template Variables

You can define variables within template files and filenames using the following syntax:

- `@{Name of a Variable}@` - This placeholder will be replaced with user-defined values during project creation. And will be prompted like this:

```plaintext
Name of a Variable: ________
```

Yes, you can use spaces in the variable name! ðŸ˜„

For the example see: [examples](examples)

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- **Template Groups**: Organize your templates into logical groups for easy navigation.
- **Customizable Variables**: Enhance templates by leveraging variable placeholders for dynamic project creation.
